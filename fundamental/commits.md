# Commits

**Commits** are the core building block units of a **Git project** timeline. Commits can be thought of as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of a _Git_ project.

Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch.

Git assigns each commit a unique ID that identifies :&#x20;

* The specific changes
* When the changes were made
* Who created the changes
